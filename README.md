### Flood Map
This class reads terrain values and a water level value and determines which terrain will be above the water or flooded.

A Map is randomly generated with terrain of different altitudes.

The map is then slowly flooded in increments of 10 until it is full.

### Roaches Viewers

A collection of two different displays for simulating a population of cockroaches.

The first class, RoachPopulationViewer, displays an interactive GUI to modify and change the values of the population of
roaches.  It also has an exterminator come every 10 seconds to kill 10% of the population

The second class, RoachSimulation visualizes the growth of a roach population over a timeframe of 10 generations.  A timer waits
1/2 of a second before either doubling the population or killing a portion of the population.  The simulation lasts 10 seconds.
